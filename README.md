Tools for B-spline based Galerkin and collocation methods in Julia.

## Features

This package provides:

- B-spline bases of arbitrary order on uniform and non-uniform grids;

- evaluation of splines and their derivatives and integrals;

- spline interpolations;

- basis recombination, for generating bases satisfying homogeneous boundary
  conditions using linear combinations of B-splines.
  Supported boundary conditions include Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin, and more
  complex variants;

- banded Galerkin and collocation matrices for solving differential equations,
  using B-spline and recombined bases;

- efficient "banded" 3D arrays as an extension of banded matrices.
  These can store 3D tensors associated to quadratic terms in Galerkin methods.

## Example usage

The following is a very brief overview of some of the functionality provided
by this package.

- Create B-spline basis of order `k = 4` (polynomial degree 3) from a given
  set of breakpoints:

  ```julia
  breaks = -1:0.1:1
  B = BSplineBasis(4, breaks)
  ```

- Create derived basis satisfying homogeneous [Robin boundary
  conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_boundary_condition) on the
  two boundaries:

  ```julia
  bc = Derivative(0) + 3Derivative(1)
  R = RecombinedBSplineBasis(bc, B)  # satisfies u âˆ“ 3u' = 0 on the left/right boundary
  ```

- Construct [mass matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_matrix) and
  [stiffness matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness_matrix) for
  the Galerkin method in the recombined basis:

  ```julia
  # By default, M and L are Hermitian banded matrices
  M = galerkin_matrix(R)
  L = galerkin_matrix(R, (Derivative(1), Derivative(1)))
  ```

- Construct banded 3D tensor associated to non-linear term of the [Burgers
  equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgers%27_equation):

  ```julia
  T = galerkin_tensor(R, (Derivative(0), Derivative(1), Derivative(0)))
  ```

A tutorial showcasing this and much more functionality is coming in the
future.

## Comparison with similar packages

This project presents several similarities with the excellent
[BSplines](https://github.com/sostock/BSplines.jl) package.
This includes various types and functions which have the same names (e.g.
`BSplineBasis`, `Spline`, `knots`, `order`).
In most cases this is pure coincidence, as I wasn't aware of BSplines when
development of BSplineKit started.
Some inspiration was later taken from that package (including, for instance,
the idea of a `Derivative` type).

Some design differences with the BSplines package include:

- in BSplineKit, the B-spline order `k` is considered a compile-time
  constant, as it is encoded in the `BSplineBasis` type.
  This leads to important performance gains when evaluating splines.
  It also enables the construction of efficient 3D banded structures based on
  stack-allocated
  [StaticArrays](https://github.com/JuliaArrays/StaticArrays.jl);

- we do not assume that knots are repeated `k` times at the boundaries, even
  though this is still the default when creating a B-spline basis.
  This is to allow the possibility of imposing periodic boundary conditions
  on the basis.

In addition to the common functionality,
BSplineKit provides easy to use tools for solving
[boundary-value problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_value_problem)
using B-splines.
This includes the generation of bases satisfying a chosen set of boundary
conditions (*basis recombination*), as well as the construction of
arrays for solving such problems using collocation and Galerkin methods.
